# DiscordFavoritesEmotesSaver
Easily add and save your favourite Discord emotes (like "frequently used")

You can add emotes one by one with alt + click, but when you log out or change client, the favorites disappear... So, I created a program to solve this problem.

Coming soon (maybe in some hours)...
